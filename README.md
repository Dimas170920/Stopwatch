on React

Implement a stopwatch that counts time in the format "HH:MM:SS".

The timer should have the following buttons:

"Start/Stop" - starts/stops the timer, stops and resets the timer value.

"Wait" - works on double click (time between clicks not more than 300 ms!) the timer should stop counting; if start is pressed after that, the countdown resumes.

"Reset" - resets the timer to 0. Resets the timer and starts the countdown again.

Requirements:

use Observables in the code

RxJS approach

functional approach

300ms - this is not DoubleClick
